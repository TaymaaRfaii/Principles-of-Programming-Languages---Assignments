This repository contains my assignments and solutions for the **Principles of Programming Languages** course.

The course provides a deep and structured exploration of how programming languages are designed, specified, and implemented, with a strong emphasis on:

- **TypeScript-based functional programming**
- **Interpreters and operational semantics**
- **Type systems and type inference**
- **Scheme programming and substitution/environments**
- **Continuation Passing Style (CPS) and control structures**
- **Logic programming and unification**
